# Computer Engineering Essential Final Project (Group 29): Karnbann(การบ้าน) Board Project Management

---

This project is a final project for the Computer Engineering Essentials course. It is a project management system inspired by Kanban board that aims to help teams manage their projects more efficiently.

## Project Description

The Kanban board project management system is a web-based application that allows students to manage their assignments using a visual board that displays the assignment's progress. The board consists of 3 columns, each representing a stage in the project development process. These columns could be named "Not started", "In Progress", and "Done".

The system allows students to get tasks from **MycoursevilleAPI** and move them across the board as they progress.

The Kanban board project management system provides an overview of the course status and progress, allowing student to see what tasks are assigned to them, what tasks are in progress, and what tasks are completed.

## Features

The Kanban board project management system has the following features:

- User authentication and authorization
- Column management
- Task movement across columns
- Real-time updates

## Technologies

The Kanban board project management system is built using the following technologies:

- Vanilla Javascript for the frontend (no libraries and frameworks)
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend
- DynamoDB for the database
